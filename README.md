# iGEMITB2017
The codes of Drylab Team, iGEM ITB 2017 to support the wetlab. Link of our project can be accessed here : http://2017.igem.org/Team:ITB_Indonesia/Model?

Contributed by Muhammad Naufal Hakim (Bioengineering ITB 2014), Mudita Gunawan (Mathematics ITB 2014), and Andre Hendrawan (Chemical Engineering ITB 2013)

Our codes are divided into some parts that support our main goals in iGEM 2017 Competition. These codes are :

1. Making simulations of PETase production based on mRNA concentrations. This part divided into two files, mRNA_PETase_main that contains simulation parameter
and condition of simulation, and mRNA_PETase_calc to calculate and simulate result from mRNA_PETase_main. These files are available in this repository.
